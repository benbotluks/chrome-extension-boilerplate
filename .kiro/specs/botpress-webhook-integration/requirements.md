# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing Chrome extension template to include Botpress webhook operations, allowing users to interact with Botpress chatbots directly from the browser extension popup. The integration will provide a seamless way to send messages to Botpress webhooks and display responses within the extension interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure Botpress webhook settings in the extension, so that I can connect to my specific Botpress chatbot instance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a configuration section for Botpress webhook settings
2. WHEN the user enters a webhook URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and save it to local storage
3. WHEN the user enters an API key or authentication token THEN the system SHALL securely store the credentials
4. IF the webhook URL is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent saving
5. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to my Botpress chatbot through the extension, so that I can interact with the bot without leaving my current browser context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL enable the send button
2. WHEN the user clicks send or presses Enter THEN the system SHALL send the message to the configured Botpress webhook
3. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN the message is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat interface
5. IF the webhook request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option
6. WHEN the input field is empty THEN the system SHALL disable the send button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see responses from my Botpress chatbot in a chat-like interface, so that I can have natural conversations with the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Botpress webhook returns a response THEN the system SHALL display the bot's message in the chat interface
2. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL differentiate between user messages and bot responses visually
3. WHEN multiple messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history during the session
4. WHEN the chat interface has many messages THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
5. IF the bot response contains rich content THEN the system SHALL render it appropriately (links, formatting)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to remember my conversation context, so that I can continue conversations across extension sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user closes and reopens the extension THEN the system SHALL restore the previous conversation history
2. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL use Chrome extension storage APIs
3. WHEN the conversation history exceeds storage limits THEN the system SHALL remove oldest messages first
4. WHEN the user wants to clear history THEN the system SHALL provide a clear conversation option
5. IF storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to session-only storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle Botpress webhook authentication properly, so that secure communication is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making webhook requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN storing authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL use secure Chrome extension storage
4. IF credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to configure them
5. WHEN credentials expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh or re-authentication gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension interface to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can easily interact with the Botpress integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension popup opens THEN the system SHALL display within standard popup dimensions
2. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive and accessible
3. WHEN there are long messages THEN the system SHALL handle text wrapping appropriately
4. WHEN the user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. IF the extension is loading data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
