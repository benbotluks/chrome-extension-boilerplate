# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current codebase contains repetitive error handling patterns across hooks and services, particularly visible in `useContentScraping.ts`. This feature will create reusable error handling utilities that reduce code duplication and provide consistent error management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable error handling hook, so that I can eliminate repetitive try-catch blocks and error state management across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an async operation is executed THEN the hook SHALL automatically handle errors and loading states
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the hook SHALL provide consistent error message formatting
3. WHEN errors need to be cleared THEN the hook SHALL provide a simple clear method
4. WHEN multiple async operations run THEN the hook SHALL handle concurrent states correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling utilities for services, so that I can standardize error processing across all service classes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service method encounters an error THEN the utility SHALL format it consistently
2. WHEN different error types occur THEN the utility SHALL categorize them appropriately (network, validation, configuration)
3. WHEN errors are processed THEN the utility SHALL preserve original error context for debugging
4. WHEN user-facing errors are needed THEN the utility SHALL provide friendly error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor existing hooks, so that they use the new error handling patterns while maintaining the same external API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing hooks are refactored THEN their public interfaces SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN code duplication SHALL be significantly reduced
3. WHEN hooks use the new utilities THEN error handling SHALL be more consistent
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN error information SHALL be more detailed and useful
