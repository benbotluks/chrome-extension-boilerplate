# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chrome extension currently has a navigation issue where users cannot access the configuration page once the bot is configured. When a user clicks the settings button to navigate to the configuration page, the app automatically switches back to the chat interface due to an overly aggressive useEffect that forces navigation to chat whenever the bot is configured.

This prevents users from:
- Updating their Botpress webhook ID
- Modifying content scraping settings
- Resetting their configuration
- Accessing any configuration options after initial setup

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a configured bot, I want to access the configuration page when I click the settings button, so that I can update my bot settings or content scraping configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the settings button in the chat interface THEN the system SHALL navigate to the configuration page
2. WHEN the configuration page is displayed THEN the system SHALL remain on the configuration page until the user explicitly navigates away
3. WHEN the user is on the configuration page THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically redirect them back to chat

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on the configuration page, I want to be able to cancel my changes and return to chat, so that I can go back without saving modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Cancel" button on the configuration page THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the chat interface
2. WHEN a user successfully saves configuration changes THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the chat interface
3. IF the user has unsaved changes and clicks cancel THEN the system SHALL return to chat without applying the changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation logic to be predictable and only change views when I explicitly request it, so that I have control over the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes and the bot is not configured THEN the system SHALL show the configuration page
2. WHEN the app initializes and the bot is configured THEN the system SHALL show the chat interface
3. WHEN a user explicitly navigates to a different view THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically override that navigation
4. WHEN the configuration state changes due to user action THEN the system SHALL only navigate if the user initiated the configuration change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings button to remain accessible and functional at all times when the bot is configured, so that I can always access configuration options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is configured and the chat interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a settings button in the header
2. WHEN a user clicks the settings button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the configuration page with current settings pre-populated
3. WHEN the configuration page is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current webhook ID and content scraping settings
4. WHEN the user is on the configuration page THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to chat (cancel button)
