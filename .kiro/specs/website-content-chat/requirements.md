# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Chrome extension that allows users to chat with their Botpress bot about the content of the currently active website. The extension will extract webpage content, send it to the Botpress bot for analysis, and provide an interactive chat interface where users can ask questions, request summaries, or get insights about the website they're viewing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to automatically extract content from the current webpage, so that my Botpress bot can analyze and discuss the page content with me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the current active tab's URL
2. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL extract text content from the current webpage
3. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL ignore navigation elements, ads, and irrelevant content
4. WHEN the page content is large THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate or summarize to fit API limits
5. IF content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow manual URL input
6. WHEN content is successfully extracted THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the extracted content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my Botpress bot settings, so that the extension can communicate with my specific bot instance for content analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first opens the extension THEN the system SHALL prompt for Botpress configuration
2. WHEN the user enters webhook URL and credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the connection
3. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL test the connection with a sample message
4. IF the bot connection fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL store settings securely using Chrome extension storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to chat with my Botpress bot about the website content, so that I can get summaries, ask questions, and extract insights from the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL send both the message and page content to the Botpress bot
2. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL include relevant page metadata (URL, title, domain)
3. WHEN the bot responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in a chat interface
4. WHEN asking follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain context of the current page content
5. IF the page content changes THEN the system SHALL offer to refresh the content for analysis
6. WHEN the user switches tabs THEN the system SHALL detect the change and offer to analyze the new page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see suggested questions about the current webpage, so that I can quickly get common insights without typing custom queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL display suggested questions based on content type
2. WHEN the user clicks a suggested question THEN the system SHALL send it to the bot automatically
3. WHEN the page is an article THEN the system SHALL suggest "Summarize this article" and "What are the key points?"
4. WHEN the page is a product page THEN the system SHALL suggest "What are the main features?" and "Compare with alternatives"
5. WHEN the page is a news article THEN the system SHALL suggest "What's the main story?" and "Who are the key people mentioned?"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to handle different types of web content appropriately, so that I can analyze various websites effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is a news article THEN the system SHALL extract headline, author, date, and main content
2. WHEN the page is an e-commerce product THEN the system SHALL extract product name, price, description, and reviews
3. WHEN the page is a blog post THEN the system SHALL extract title, author, publication date, and content
4. WHEN the page is a documentation page THEN the system SHALL extract headings, code examples, and explanatory text
5. IF the page type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL extract general text content and metadata
6. WHEN the page has dynamic content THEN the system SHALL wait for content to load before extraction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and reference previous conversations about websites, so that I can return to insights from pages I've analyzed before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL save the chat history with the associated URL
2. WHEN the user revisits a previously analyzed page THEN the system SHALL offer to show previous conversations
3. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN the system SHALL display the page title, URL, and date of analysis
4. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL remove oldest conversations first
5. IF the user wants to clear history THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear individual or all conversations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work efficiently without slowing down my browsing, so that I can analyze content without performance impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL do so without blocking the main browser thread
2. WHEN the extension is not actively used THEN the system SHALL minimize resource consumption
3. WHEN processing large pages THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL only process the active tab
5. IF content extraction takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and provide fallback options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle permissions and security properly, so that user data and browsing activity remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing page content THEN the system SHALL only request necessary Chrome extension permissions
2. WHEN storing conversation data THEN the system SHALL use secure Chrome extension storage APIs
