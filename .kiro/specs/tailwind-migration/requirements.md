# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Chrome extension from custom CSS styling to Tailwind CSS. The project currently uses component-specific CSS files and global styles, and we want to replace these with Tailwind's utility-first approach while maintaining the exact same visual appearance and functionality. This migration will improve maintainability, reduce CSS bundle size, and provide a more consistent design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all existing CSS with Tailwind utility classes, so that I can leverage a utility-first CSS framework for better maintainability and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL have Tailwind CSS properly configured and integrated with Vite
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing CSS files SHALL be removed or replaced with Tailwind utilities
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the visual appearance SHALL remain identical to the current implementation
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the build process SHALL successfully compile Tailwind styles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Tailwind to work seamlessly with the existing React TypeScript setup, so that I can continue using modern development practices without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind is configured THEN it SHALL integrate properly with the existing Vite build system
2. WHEN Tailwind is configured THEN it SHALL work with TypeScript without type conflicts
3. WHEN Tailwind is configured THEN hot module replacement SHALL continue to work during development
4. WHEN Tailwind is configured THEN the Chrome extension build process SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the current component structure and functionality, so that the migration doesn't break existing features or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are migrated THEN all React components SHALL maintain their current functionality
2. WHEN components are migrated THEN the ChatInterface component SHALL preserve its current layout and interactions
3. WHEN components are migrated THEN the ConfigurationPanel component SHALL maintain its current styling and behavior
4. WHEN components are migrated THEN responsive behavior SHALL be preserved if it exists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to follow Tailwind best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility classes are applied THEN they SHALL follow Tailwind's recommended patterns and conventions
2. WHEN custom styles are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented using Tailwind's @apply directive or CSS-in-JS patterns
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the configuration SHALL include only necessary Tailwind features to minimize bundle size
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the setup SHALL support future Tailwind updates and customization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the Chrome extension continues to work properly after the migration, so that users experience no disruption in functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is built THEN it SHALL load properly in Chrome with Manifest V3
2. WHEN the extension popup is opened THEN all styling SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN the extension is tested THEN all interactive elements SHALL function as before
4. WHEN the build is created THEN the CSS bundle size SHALL be optimized compared to the current implementation
