# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing Botpress chat integration by implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time message streaming. Instead of manually fetching messages after sending, the application will listen for incoming messages automatically, providing a more responsive chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive bot messages in real-time, so that the conversation feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL establish an SSE connection using the Botpress Chat API
2. WHEN the bot sends a message THEN the system SHALL receive it immediately via the `message_created` event
3. WHEN a message is received via SSE THEN the system SHALL add it to the chat interface
4. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL stop manually fetching messages and rely on SSE events
5. IF the SSE connection fails THEN the system SHALL continue working with the existing message fetching

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SSE implementation to integrate with the existing chat hook, so that no major refactoring is needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSE is implemented THEN the system SHALL use the existing `useBotpressChat` hook structure
2. WHEN SSE events are received THEN the system SHALL update the same `messages` state array
3. WHEN SSE is active THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate messages from manual fetching
4. WHEN the conversation changes THEN the system SHALL establish a new SSE connection for the new conversation
5. IF SSE is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to the current manual fetching approach
